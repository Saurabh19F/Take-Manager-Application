Build a Task Manager Application


Effective task management is crucial for productivity and organization. A task manager application can help users keep track of their tasks, set priorities, and mark tasks as completed. This project will involve developing a Task Manager application using AngularJS to handle dynamic data and user interactions.


Your task is to create a Task Manager application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application should be built using AngularJS, HTML, and CSS, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.


Goals and Objectives:


To design and develop a Task Manager application using AngularJS.

To demonstrate the ability to use AngularJS for data binding, directives, and handling user input.

Ensure the application includes functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.


Steps to Complete the Task:


1. Set Up the Project - Create a new project directory. Inside this directory, create subdirectories for CSS, JavaScript, and any other assets. Set up an AngularJS environment (include AngularJS via a CDN or download it locally).


2. HTML Structure - Create an index.html file. Define the basic structure of the HTML document including <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. Link to Bootstrap CSS in the <head> section. Link to external CSS and JavaScript files. Add a div element with ng-app and ng-controller directives to initialize the AngularJS application and controller.


3. Header Section - Include a header with the application name (e.g., "Task Manager").


4. Task List Display - Create a section to display the list of tasks. Use ng-repeat directive to dynamically generate task elements from the data model. Each task should display its title, description, and status (completed or not completed).


5. Add Task Functionality - Create a form to add new tasks with input fields for the task title and description. Use ng-model to bind form inputs to the data model. Add a button to submit the form and add the task to the list.




6. Edit Task Functionality - Include an "Edit" button for each task in the list. When clicked, the task's details should become editable, allowing the user to update the title and description. Add a button to save the changes and update the task in the data model.


7. Delete Task Functionality - Include a "Delete" button for each task in the list. When clicked, the task should be removed from the list and the data model.


8. Mark Task as Completed - Include a checkbox or button to mark each task as completed. When checked or clicked, the task's status should be updated in the data model and visually indicated (e.g., by striking through the text).


9. Styling with CSS - Create a styles.css file in the CSS directory. Add styles to enhance the visual appeal of the application while maintaining responsiveness. Style the task list, forms, and buttons to make them user-friendly and visually appealing.


10. AngularJS Application Logic - Create an app.js file in the JavaScript directory. Define an AngularJS module and controller to manage the application logic. Use AngularJS services or a factory to handle data storage and manipulation. Implement functions to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed within the controller.
